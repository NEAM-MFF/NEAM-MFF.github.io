Sanja and I first met in 2018 when I was a PhD student at the Research Center Jülich in Germany in the group of Prof. Markus Diesmann and she was a postdoc in the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn in the lab of Prof. Stefan Remy. We quickly became friends and stayed in contact until now. Sanja played, and still plays, a very important role for my scientific career by giving me a lot of mentorship and support. It's great to have someone you can always approach and who believes in you. I am very happy to be writing the first blog post particularly about her visit.

At the moment we are putting a paper together on persistent activity of cells in the medial septum. Endre did an amazing job with in vivo recordings from the medial septum with neuropixel probes, giving us the opportunity to look at how the medial septal cells interact during both voluntary and stimulated locomotion.  We had a great day together, brainstorming together with these guys is so much fun! And many thanks to Káťa for preparing a real coffee break for us!
