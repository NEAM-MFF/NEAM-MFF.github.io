All of them were extremely valuable in different ways. We met people who work on very related topics and so far we did not know each other, got some new ideas for analysis and also met some old friends from around the world. It always so nice to chat with people who are excited about the same topics and exchange our views.\nKatarína presented her work at the PhD conference ENCODS where she scored the third place in a poster competition!\nAt the Bernstein conference in Frankfurt, Aitor gave a contributed talk on his previous postdoc work.\nSome pics :)"

    "text": "Memory consolidation is a complex process that involves many brain areas. The hippocampus plays a central role in forming new memories – it quickly stores new experiences in the form of a cognitive map with its content distributed across the neocortex. Over time, the neocortical representations are consolidated into a stable structures that can be invoked even without participation of the hippocampus.\nIn our current research, we study the spread of memory reactivations across the neocortical network. Using mathematical methods, we aim at identifying neural ensembles that participate in memory consolidation and, based on their characteristics, separate distinct memory processes.\nWe actively collaborate with several experimental research groups:"

    "title": "How to support women in science?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It was an honor to be invited to a debate on what we can do to help women stay in science organized by the German Embassy in Prague. The audience was diverse, from equal opportunities officers from Czech scientific institutions (yes, some Czech institutions already have them!) to high school students who are thinking about their future life. I was very happy that they approached me after the discussion to talk more informally and ask questions.\nWhat were the topics that I raised in this context?\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nSelf-confidence\nWhen planning theses projects with the students, I see a bias that female students have more doubts whether they succeed in the project compared to their male colleagues. It is very important that we create an environment, starting from early childhood, leading to self-confident students that can assess their abilities, but do not systematically underestimate them. At the university level, this involves inclusive conditions where nobody is afraid to ask questions or say that they do not understand something. It also means that supervisors should care about the students. I see it as my task to plan the project and provide sufficient supervision such that the students will manage if they put appropriate effort in it, so there is no need to be afraid. It is very rewarding to see students excited in their projects and feeling to be part of the team! Yes, you will manage! :)\n\n\nRole models\nIt was very important for me to take inspiration from other female scientists who were senior researchers and mothers at the same time. Managing everything perfectly when you are a senior scientist and a mother is simply not possible - sometimes it takes a bit longer to respond to emails, other times you may not manage to read all the papers that you would like to read in detail before a meeting. And yes, you may also forget that your child needs to take on the shoes before leaving the kindergarten (indeed, this happened to me :)). It is very important to learn to prioritize and also to be tolerant to yourself. Role models are invaluable on this journey.\nParticularly at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics where my group is based, it may be difficult to find female role models as the percentage of female faculty members is low. I see this as one of my tasks to support other women in their scientific careers and pass on any experience that may be useful to them. A mentoring programme can serve this purpose very well.\n\n\nFlexible parental leave\nIn Germany, where I worked when my children were born, parental leave is very flexible. It is supported that both parents take some time off and they can freely decide who stays at home for how long. It is also possible to take turns, even within a day such that one parent works in the morning and the other in the afternoon. This flexibility eases the situation of women and enables them to stay in touch with the science, while still having enough time for their children. I also took the opportunity to work part time until my children were 3 years old which I greatly enjoyed. In the Czech Republic, the system enforces a very imbalanced splitting of work and childcare beetween the parents which, in my opinion, makes the situation worse for everybody - the children, the parents, the society and also the state. I hope that the Czech society will start appreciating the involvement of both parents in both childcare and work and that the situation will change soon."

    "text": "Sanja and I first met in 2018 when I was a PhD student at the Research Center Jülich in Germany in the group of Prof. Markus Diesmann and she was a postdoc in the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn in the lab of Prof. Stefan Remy. We quickly became friends and stayed in contact until now. Sanja played, and still plays, a very important role for my scientific career by giving me a lot of mentorship and support. It’s great to have someone you can always approach and who believes in you. I am very happy to be writing the first blog post particularly about her visit.\nAt the moment we are putting a paper together on persistent activity of cells in the medial septum. Endre did an amazing job with in vivo recordings from the medial septum with neuropixel probes, giving us the opportunity to look at how the medial septal cells interact during both voluntary and stimulated locomotion. We had a great day together, brainstorming together with these guys is so much fun! And many thanks to Káťa for preparing a real coffee break for us!"

    "text": "The last three days in the lab of Eduardo Fernandez at the Miguel Hernandez University in Elche were very inspiring. Eduardo and his team develop a neuroprosthesis for blind people – an array of microelectrodes implanted in the visual cortex. When the electrodes are stimulated, the subjects see dots of light called phosphenes. It is amazing how much new and unexpected knowledge we learn from every single every participant in the study. The visual experience from electrical stimulation is so different for each of the volunteers! We are very thankful that we could design some experiments that generated extremely valuable data for us.\nFor the first time in our lives, we also saw a beautiful response of a retinal gangion cell to drifting gratings. Cristina Soto Sanchez invited us to look at her in vitro recordings from a mouse retina stimulated by various stimuli. It is so exciting to hear the responses of the cells in real time! And also to see Cristina so excited about our excitement. :)"
